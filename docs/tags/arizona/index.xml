Description Robertoâ€™s annual 150 miles.
Just like any other ride, know your own abilities and plan for a great day. Bring plenty of nutrition. We have scheduled stops to help increase that calorie count.
In the case of extreme adverse weather, we postpone until the following day. Stay for margaritas &amp;amp; dinner at Nandos after the ride.</description>

Description This is the infamous canal ride from Chandler to Peoria.
We will tour a series of canals around town. Sag stops at gas stations &amp;amp; maybe a taco stand or two.
If you can&amp;rsquo;t make the full ride, plan to jump in with us for part of the ride.</description>
