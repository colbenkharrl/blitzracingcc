# Description

Roberto’s annual 150 miles.

Just like any other ride, know your own abilities and plan for a great day. Bring plenty of nutrition. We have scheduled stops to help increase that calorie count.

In the case of extreme adverse weather, we postpone until the following day.
Stay for margaritas & dinner at Nandos after the ride.

**Two Groups:**

- A Group (pace 20+ mph).
- B Group (pace 18+ mph).
