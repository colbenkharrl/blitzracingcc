# Description

This is the infamous canal ride from Chandler to Peoria.

We will tour a series of canals around town. Sag stops at gas stations & maybe a taco stand or two.

If you can't make the full ride, plan to jump in with us for part of the ride.

This will be a fun, casual ride, but still challenging at over 100 miles.

Low temps are expected, so take plenty of gear.

Start and end at Pedal Hause Brewery in Chandler. Of course there will be beer at the end.
